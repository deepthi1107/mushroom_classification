- It is a supervised machine learning model
- It is used when the output is numeric in nature
- It uses the penalties from both lasso and ridge regressions to regularize the models.
- It learns the shortcomings of lasso and ridge regressions to improve the regularization of statistical models.
- To avoid the limitations in lasso, the elastic net introduces a quadratic expression in the penalty, which then becomes ridge regression.

**Advantages and disadvantages:**
- It is like a regularization
- It helps in improving the model by combing lasso and ridge 
- The computational burden is high and costly.

**Conclusion:**
- It performs both variable selection and regularization simultaneously.
- This method is more suitable where the dimensional data is greater than the number of samples used.
- Groupings and variable selection are the key aspects of this technique.
