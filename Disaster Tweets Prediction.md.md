- # Introduction:
- Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
- The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency theyâ€™re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

## Goal:
Prediction of Disaster Tweets .

## Libraries used :
The required libraries for this project work
- Numpy==1.19.2
- Pandas==1.2.4
- Matplotlib==3.4.2
- Sklearn
- Seaborn

## Work Flow:
Load the dataset -> EDA -> Model Building -> Evaluation -> Deployment

- Plot to check the null values.




## Accuracy:
Naive Bayes:  64.279902
Logistic regression: 62.655205


## Conclusion:
- Naive Bayes is used to train the data.
- Goal is to predict the disaster tweets using Naive Bayes.
